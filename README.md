🌾 AI-Powered Smart Farming Solution
📌 Introduction
Agriculture is the backbone of India's economy, yet many farmers lack access to data-driven insights, leading to:

🌾 Poor Crop Choices → Lower yields & financial losses
❌ Soil Degradation → Unbalanced fertilizer use
⛈ Climate Change Impact → Unpredictable weather patterns
💰 Market Disconnect → Crop oversupply & pricing losses
⚡ Our Solution
An AI-driven, user-friendly web application that helps farmers make data-driven decisions for crop selection, fertilizer usage, and agricultural planning by integrating real-time environmental data, soil analysis, and historical weather patterns.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Smart Crop Selection
Suggests the best crops based on soil nutrients, weather, and location.
Uses machine learning to analyze N, P, K, pH, soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall, precipitation probability, and sunshine duration.
Improves yield efficiency and reduces crop failures.
✅ Fertilizer Optimization
Provides customized fertilizer recommendations tailored to crop requirements and soil deficiencies.
Ensures balanced nutrient management while preserving long-term soil health.
Reduces chemical overuse, minimizing environmental impact.
✅ Real-Time Weather Insights
Continuously monitors soil moisture (0–81 cm), temperature fluctuations, humidity, and precipitation probability.
Uses real-time weather APIs to adapt recommendations based on changing conditions.
Helps farmers plan irrigation cycles and mitigate weather risks.
✅ AI-Powered Crop Disease Prediction
Detects potential crop diseases early and recommends preventive measures.
Analyzes historical and real-time environmental data to predict disease outbreaks.
Enhances farmers' ability to protect their crops before major losses occur.
✅ Google Maps Integration
Uses Google Maps API (JavaScript) to help farmers locate nearby:
🌾 Soil Testing Labs
🌱 Fertilizer Suppliers
🚜 Agricultural Assistance Centers
Enables geographical mapping for farm monitoring.
